# wpa-wordlists
```A collecting of wordslists for wpa-cracking. Just for my own use but feel free to get them yourself.

Some are from Kali's own system and others are gathered from various places on the internet and are of varying quality.

These can be used with aircrack or hashcat or whatever you need a wordlist for.

Some gits I have used to collect these:
https://github.com/martinlindhe/wordlist_swedish
https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists
https://github.com/zxcV32/indian-wordlist

I also recommend a visit to https://weakpass.com/wordlist for more extensive lists. They are far too big to include here (100gb+ some of them)

These lists are provided as a group split gz-files due to githubs restrictions of big files.

Share as much as you want!
